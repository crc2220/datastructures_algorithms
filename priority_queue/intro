Send in the priority [‘example’, 3]
And arrange them according to priority
If they are the same then the new one gets behind the older one

splice()
Has three arguments 
1. Index you want to start at
2. How many items in array you want to delete
3. What you want to add

Splice:Add item at position
array.splice(1, 0, “5”);
Insert “5” at position 1, and don’t replace anything (0)

slice() vs splice()
Both return the same thing
Slice doesn’t modify the array
Splice does modify the array
Think the “p” as permanent change 

slice()
Splice:Copy an array
Const newVariable = array.slice()

If it’s empty just add it to the queue
If it’s not empty loop through collection and see if new item’s priority is less than the i-th item’s priority
If so then splice it to the collection and set added to true
If it wasn’t added then push it to collection 
— [[“example”, 5]] now try adding [“another”, 6] 
— since 6 isn’t less than 5 we need the fallback/flag to add it to end of collection
