ES6 has a set for us to use
A collection we can just use an array in javascript 
-has
-values
-add
-remove (check if it “has” a value first)
-size
-union (combines two sets together)
-intersection (creates a set with similar items from both sets)
-difference (creates a set with difference between both sets)
-subset (if a set is in another set)
