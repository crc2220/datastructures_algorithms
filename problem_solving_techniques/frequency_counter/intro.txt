Frequency Counter
collect frequency of values

Example
* You have two arrays, one with integers, second squared of each from 1st
* [1,2,3] [1,4,9]
* Does each item in array 1, when it is squared, have matching item in array 2?
* 1st example does a double loop which is o of n squared â€” try to avoid double looping this is time intensive
* 2nd example does o of n
* basically creates a lookup object or hash map/hash table
* { key: (number of times it occurs) }
* do this for both arrays - twice - 2n
* then also do a third loop that checks the keys/counts
    * Can you exit early?
* So there are three loops === o(3n)
* see code example a.1
