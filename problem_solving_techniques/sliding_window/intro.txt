You create a "window" 
Depending on conditions:
"window" (increases) || (closes.then-> creates a new window)
-useful for keeping track of a subset of data in array/string

Example problem: longest sequence of unique characters
"hellothere"
"lother"

Another example problem: 
maxSubarraySum 
Find 2 digits that are next to each other that have the largest sum
([1,2,5,2,8,1,5],2) -- 2,8 = 10
Find 4 digits that are next to each other that have the largest sum
([1,2,5,2,8,1,5],4) -- 2,5,2,8 = 17
([], 4) = null

You don't need to loop through the next window each time
You can subtract the previous windowArray[0] value from the old_win_sum
and 
add the newest value(windowArray[window.length-1]) from the old_win_sum
